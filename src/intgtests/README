These tests require cwrap libraries to be installed and available, namely
nss_wrapper and pam_wrapper. Also, an IPA server with admin permissions
is required.

The tests use JSON-RPC to talk to the IPA server, create the objects required
for tests, set up pam_hbac with the help of pam_wrapper and run tests.
For more information about the JSON-RPC communication, see:
    https://vda.li/en/posts/2015/05/28/talking-to-freeipa-api-with-sessions/

To run the tests, point them at your IPA server and define the following
parameters:
    IPA_HOSTNAME - the host name of your IPA server
    IPA_DOMAIN - the domain of your IPA server.
    IPA_BASEDN - the base DN of your IPA server
    BIND_DN - the user pam_hbac will be authenticating as
    BIND_PW - the password of the bind user
    ADMIN_PASSWORD - the password of the 'admin' user on your IPA server
    INSECURE_TESTS - define this to '1' if your system doesn't trust the
                     IPA's CA. This parameter is used to establish
                     communication over JSON-RPC towards the IPA server,
                     which is used to create objects on the server, not
                     during the pam_hbac tests themselves

For example:
    make intgcheck IPA_HOSTNAME="unidirect.ipa.test" \
                   IPA_DOMAIN="ipa.test" \
                   IPA_BASEDN="dc=ipa,dc=test" \
                   ADMIN_PASSWORD="blablabla" \
                   BIND_DN="uid=hbac,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=ipa,dc=test" \
                   BIND_PW="Secret123" \
                   INSECURE_TESTS=1
