pam_hbac(8)
===========
:revdate: 2016-02-25

NAME
----
pam_hbac - A PAM account module that evaluates HBAC rules stored on an
IPA server

SYNOPSIS
--------
pam_hbac.so [...]

OPTIONS
-------
* *config=/path/to/file* - the path to a non-default config file. Most
installations should not use this option, but rather use the config file
at the default location. Please see the *pam_hbac.conf(5)* man page for
more details about the configuration file.

* *ignore_unknown_user* - by default, `pam_hbac` returns `PAM_UNKNOWN_USER`
if the user requesting access is not found. If this option is enabled, `pam_hbac`
will return `PAM_IGNORE` instead, causing the PAM stack to ignore this module.

* *debug* - by default, `pam_hbac` logs only messages with priority at least
`LOG_ERR`. If this option is enabled log messages of all priorities are printed.

MODULE TYPES PROVIDED
---------------------
Only the *account* module type is supported.

EXAMPLE
-------
Please note the particular PAM configuration depends on your operating
system and version. On most systems, the PAM configuration would be simply:

[source,bash]
account     sufficient    pam_localuser.so
account     required      pam_hbac.so

Adding the `pam_localuser.so` module ensures that pam_hbac wouldn't be
called for local users defined in /etc/passwd.

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------------
Your distribution should contain files specific to a certain platform. The files
are named README.$platform (for example, README.RHEL-5) and are typically located
in a docs directory. On Linux, that would be `/usr/share/doc/pam_hbac/`.
