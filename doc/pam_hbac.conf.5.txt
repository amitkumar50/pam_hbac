NAME
----
pam_hbac.conf - The configuration file of the pam_hbac.so access module

SYNOPSIS
--------
This man page describes the pam_hbac config file, its format and options

FILE FORMAT
-----------
The pam_hbac.conf configuration uses a simple key=value format. Whitespace
on the beginning of the line, at the end of the line and around the equal
sign is ignored. The case of the keys does not matter. The values should not
be quoted as the quotes are not removed and the values are used verbatim.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
---------------------
 * URI - the LDAP URI pointing to the IPA server. At the moment, only one
 value is supported. This is a required option.
    ** Example: URI = ldap://dc.ipa.domain.test

 * BASE - the LDAP search base of your IPA server. This is a required option.
    ** Example: BASE = dc=ipa,dc=domain,dc=test

 * BIND_DN - The default bind DN to use for performing LDAP searches. It
 is recommended to create a bind user (see below). This is a required option.
    ** Example: BIND_DN = uid=hbac,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,dc=ipa,dc=domain,dc=test

 * BIND_PW - The cleartext password of the account specified in the
 `BIND_DN` option. Please note that the pam_hbac.conf file is normally
 world-readable, so please don't include a valuable account's password
 here. This is a required option.
    ** Example: BIND_PW = thisisasecret

 * HOST_NAME - the host name of the client machine. You should only set
 this option if *hostname(1)* reports a different host name than this client
 machine has registered with the IPA server
    ** Example: HOST_NAME = client.ipa.domain.test

 * SSL_PATH - Specifies the location of certificates for the Certificate
 Authorities that pam_hbac will recognize. On most systems (all that ship with
 OpenLDAP libraries), this is a path to a certificate file. On some systems,
 like Omnios or older Solaris releases that do not ship OpenLDAP libraries,
 this must be a path to a directory containing the NSS database that contains
 the certificate. If this option is not set, libldap defaults will be used.
    ** Example (certificate file): SSL_PATH = /etc/openldap/cacerts/ipa.crt

CREATING A BIND USER
--------------------
Most of the data that pam_hbac reads from the IPA server requires an
authenticated connection. Because at the moment, only a simple bind with a
DN and a password is supported, you might want to create a special bind user
for pam_hbac. To do so, prepare an LDIF file with the following contents:

[source,bash]
dn: uid=hbac,cn=sysaccounts,cn=etc,$DC
objectClass: account
objectClass: simplesecurityobject
objectClass: top
uid: hbac
userPassword: $PASSWORD

Replace the $PASSWORD value with the desired password of the bind user
and $DC with the base DN of your IPA server. Then add this LDIF to the IPA server:

[source,bash]
ldapadd -ZZ -H ldap://$IPA_HOSTNAME -D"cn=Directory Manager" -W < hbac_sysuser.ldif

You will be asked for the Directory Manager password.

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------------
In addition to the man pages that contain information that applies to any OS,
pam_hbac also ships documentation specific to certain platforms. Those docs
can be found either in shipped in the docdir on your OS or online at
https://github.com/jhrozek/pam_hbac/tree/master/doc
